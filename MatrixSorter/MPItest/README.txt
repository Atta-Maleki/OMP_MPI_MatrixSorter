THE FINAL EXECUTABLE AND CORRECT CODE THAT IS STATISFEING THE REQUIRMENT OF
ASSIGNMENT IS FILE WITH NAME :


mq3.cpp

This code is actually has written with spirit of the OMP code and the only way to 
 implement that code in MPI was the way that uses MPI_gather() and MPI_Scatter.
 
 numbers at the end of the name of codes in this solution is showing the steps of 
 learning and getting exprienced. 
 
 the fourth code called "mq4.cpp" is the failed try to for replaicing the MPI_send and MPI_Recv
 with gather and scatter. because of limitation of time before the deadline that was not
 possible to achieve this honor but after uploading the Homework to the site it will be 
 modified for the defense session of the code. The main goal of learning is not forgotten. 
 
 the final word about the gather and scatter is that I know that scatter actually 
 sending the complete data for other nodes and the gather eather. but this code works
  fine for now and it will be modified to send and recieve the correct data by 
  nodes well.
 
  
  
  for saving time during the runnig process prints are just 5500 data from the head 
  and the end of the mainArray (sorted).
