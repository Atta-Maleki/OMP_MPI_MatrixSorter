THE FINAL EXECUTABLE AND CORRECT CODE THAT IS STATISFEING THE REQUIRMENT OF
ASSIGNMENT IS FILE WITH NAME :


OMPmqSort--X.cpp

this code is exactaly splitting data in parallel and then each thread is
sorting its own subArray and then data gets merged in parallel. 

because of using merge sort and quick sort at the same time in the code the code has got named 
 in this way .
 
 the solution of the Visual Studio is uploaded to show that the code has written step by step
 during the learning process. 
 
 other codes are useless and are marked to use them in defense meeting. 
 
 
  
  
  for saving time during the runnig process prints are just 5500 data from the head 
  and the end of the mainArray (sorted).
